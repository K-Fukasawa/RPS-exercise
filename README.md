# RPS-exercise
Environment Setup
Create and activate a new project-specific Anaconda virtual environment:

```sh
conda create -n my-game-env python=3.8 # (first time only)
```

```sh
conda activate my-game-env
```

From within the virtual environment, demonstrate your ability to run the Python script from the command-line:

```sh
python game.py
```
If you see the "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot!" message, you're ready to move on to project development.
